TESTING SCENARIO

0. Clean database
	
	delete from findata.entryqueue;
	delete from findata.routedmessages;
	delete from findata.feedbackagg;
	delete from findata.batchjobs;
        delete from findata.batchrequests;
        delete from backoffice.sepin;


1. Send outgoing transactions to processing [BO app - > FinTP]
	
	update backoffice.sepout set coderoare = '0';

**transactions are successfully acquired when all records have values of '2' in the backoffice.sepout.coderoare field.

	
2. (wait until all records reach findata.entryqueue table) Group transactions into a batch and send it towards the external system [FinTP -> AMQ]
	
	select findata.test_createbatchrequest('ACHOutQueue', 'CoreBlkLrgRmtCdtTrf', '', '3112201423:00:00', 'BNKAROB0', '140606', '', '', '', '');
	
	
3. Edit the sample reply message received from external application
   
   Replace the batch_id value in INVALID_Batch_reply.xml file with the value found in findata.batchjobs.combatchid field.


4. Paste the content of the newly edited INVALID_Batch_reply.xml file in the FTMtoFINTP AMQ queue.


5. The reply should be sent to the BO app in the backoffice.sepin table
